# Resume-Page
https://danielbrechner.github.io/Resume-Page/

My project is a resume page where I will be able to introduce myself to potential employers. As I build up my portfolio as a front-end web developer, I will use this site to host future projects and will adjust the layout accordingly. For now, my goal is to meet the basic requirements for the front end web dev project for Code Louisville. I have designed this site with a mobile first layout and the site will scale with larger screens. The hamburger navigation is visible on mobile devices, while bigger screens it is hidden and the navigation items are displayed using flexbox. The layout on mobile is column, and on larger screens the two sections (About Me and Education) switch to two columns. I have included show/hide features to showcase my skills and education. My webpage also includes a contact form so site visitors may submit questions. For the contact form, the fullname input field requires validation in order for the form to be submitted, and once submitted, the user receives a message confirming submission.

The two CSS features I used are;

1.) A navigation menu that expands and collapses properly at desktop and mobile sizes, such as by switching between vertical and horizontal styles, or is opened and closed by clicking the “hamburger” icon
2.) Use Flexbox or CSS Grid to organize content areas based on mobile or desktop views. 

The two JavaScript features I used are;

1.)Create a form (such as a ‘Contact Us’ form), validate at least one field and then use that information on your page somehow.
2.)Show/hide one or more content areas or elements on your site through clicking a button or some other user interaction
